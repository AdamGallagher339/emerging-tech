    "##### The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) is designed to work with functions that accept a fixed number of [Boolean inputs](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/) and return a single [Boolean output](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/). Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns False or always returns True) or balanced (returns True for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function random_constant_balanced that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs."

    "##### [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function determine_constant_balanced that takes as input a function f, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze f and return the string \"constant\" or \"balanced\" depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call f to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"
