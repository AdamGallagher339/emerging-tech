To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function determine_constant_balanced that takes as input a function f, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze f and return the string \"constant\" or \"balanced\" depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call f to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"
